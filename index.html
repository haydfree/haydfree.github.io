        My name is Hayden. This website may make me look like I'm schizo or
        something. I get it. I'm not. At least, I don't think I am. I've never
        been professionally evaluated, and I'm not a psychiatrist, so I guess I
        can't really say. I'm just goofing around, having fun. Maybe that's what
        I am for sure qualified to say: I like goofing around and having fun. If
        you are here for a professional resume, you aren't getting one. I'm not
        an HR robot's delight, that's for sure -- I'm a human being. A weird
        one, perhaps an abrasive and offensive one, but a human nonetheless.
        <br /><br />
        I refuse to conform to your standards. Life is a game. None of this
        matters, so I refuse to take things too seriously. I am writing this
        because it's fun. I made this website because it was fun. I program
        because it's fun. I won't let you business majors take that away from
        me. <br /><br />

      <p class="page-about-text">
        I was born in Fairhope, Alabama, and grew up in a small town east of
        there called Elberta. What I remember of Elberta was beautiful. We lived
        in a big house with a pool, a waterslide, golf carts, four-wheelers, and
        dirt bikes. People were always at our house--it was the place to be.
        Life was good, at least on the surface. But I still carried my share of
        struggles: fitting in, chasing popularity, and trying to figure out how
        to get girls.<br /><br />
        In 7th grade, I joined the football team. I was terrible. "Was I just
        born bad at football?" I asked myself. At the time, it never occurred to
        me that skills could be learned--that with effort, discipline, and time,
        I could improve. This became one of the defining themes of my early
        life: the mistaken belief that talent is innate, that you're either born
        with it or you're not. I now know that while some people may be
        naturally inclined toward certain things, skill in anything is
        ultimately a function of consistent effort. If I want to be good at
        something, I can. Put in the time. <br /><br />

      <p class="page-about-text">
        In December of 2009, when I was 12, we moved to Arkansas--where my mom
        was from. The city of choice, Maumelle, was a great place. I met lots of
        amazing people here, and am still friends to this day with some of them.
        Maumelle, in my mind, was characterized by typical teenage debauchery. I
        remember one time we rolled people's houses with toilet paper until 4 in
        the morning and had to ride home in the backs of police cars. I had my
        struggles here too, though--just like in Elberta, with sports,
        popularity, and girls, I struggled with those things in Maumelle as
        well. What I didn't struggle with was my Call of Duty k/d. I remember in
        the Modern Warfare 3 era being well beyond my friends in terms of my
        prestige level. I was backpacking my squad so hard. I took pride in my
        performance in video games, another theme that'd persist throughout my
        later years.<br /><br />
        A few years later, we moved to Bryant. Met a lot of great people here
        too. I'd say most of my good friends today I met at Bryant. I remember
        being so bad at football that our coaches at Bryant put my twin brother
        Hunter and I in the same locker. Yeah, I should have quit then and
        there. But, that's another theme of my life: not sticking up for myself.
        Choosing comfort over self-respect. And this theme, too, would persist.
        I did finally quit football after 10th grade. <br /><br />
        We grew up Auburn fans, so I planned my whole life to go to Auburn. Even
        when we were in Arkansas. But out-of-state tuition is expensive, so
        Hunter and I decided to move back to AL to stay with our dad our final
        year of high school. That way, we could get in-state tuition. This was
        an awesome idea; I made many great friends here too. But here in Gulf
        Shores, the vibe was so different. Everyone smoked weed, drank, and
        partied on weekends. Getting thrown into that was a culture shock for
        sure. During my senior year here, I had my first beer, smoked weed for
        the first time, and had sex for the first time too. In fact, I indulged
        in the former two probably far more than I should have. At one of the
        many parties we threw, some kid there got drunk on Crown Royal, decided
        to take a bath, and fell asleep with the faucet running. The whole house
        flooded. It was hours later before anyone found him--butt-naked, but
        alive. <br /><br />
        In 2015, I graduated high school. Thanks to the lack of difficulty in
        the AL curriculum, I managed to just barely snag a 3.5 GPA. With my 27
        on the ACT, I was eligible to get a little bit of scholarship money.
        With the miniscule effort I put into my high school work, this was quite
        an accomplishment. What wasn't an accomplishment though was the fact
        that I didn't even apply for scholarship money. Scared of failing? Too
        lazy to do it? Not thinking about the future? All of the above. This is
        yet another core theme: inaction due to fear. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <div class="about-chapter-header-container">
        <h1 class="about-chapter-header">Make the Difficult Choice</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="page-about-text">
        At Auburn, I was pretty secluded--the bar scene made me nervous. I
        didn't make or have many friends. Staying home and smoking weed was far
        more attractive than going to bars or parties and certainly class. I
        knew pretty quickly after getting to Auburn that I didn't want to major
        in Biochemistry anymore, and I didn't want to be a doctor. But I kept on
        keeping on. Looking back, I was doing the best I could with what I knew
        at the time. What I didn't know at the time was best for me though was
        to suck it up, figure out what I wanted to do, and change my major.
        <br /><br />
        Boy, if anyone is reading this and in or preparing for college, if
        there's one single piece of advice I can offer you, it's this: major in
        something you love. If you don't know what you love, what your mission
        is--then it is your mission to find your mission. I would highly advise
        against doing 4 years of a degree that you don't care about.
        <br /><br />
        My time at Auburn was characterized by a severe lack of partying,
        drinking, sex, and class, and a severe overdose of Fortnite and working
        out. I didn't know what I wanted. So I did the logical thing--
        avoidance. It was a pretty dark time in my life. I think what I had
        lacked was one of the most important parts of being a mentally healthy
        human being: having something that you love, and working on it. Every
        single day. And when you don't have that, I think, as demonstrated in my
        experience, it becomes really hard to be happy. It makes sense
        evolutionarily; we evolved the dopaminergic pathway for a reason. This
        era is therefore characterized by another theme: refusal to make the
        hard choice.

      <p class="page-about-text">
        When I wasn't playing Fornite, I was trying to learn dropshipping. If
        you aren't familiar, dropshipping is an online "side-hustle" type
        business model where you sell products, but instead of holding physical
        inventory, you just buy from a vendor and ship it directly to your
        customer. I was totally unconvinced I wouldn't be mega-rich from this.
        This is actually where I got my first introduction to coding; I was
        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to customize my Shopify stores.
        <br /><br />
        Due to my extreme addiction to video games and my newfound obsession
        with dropshipping, my prioritization of class was moved from -1 to -10.
        I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I went to class
        during my final year. As is customary with students who don't attend
        class, I performed poorly--so poorly in fact that I flunked out in my
        final year. Due to my guaranteed success with dropshipping, I decided to
        focus on it, and not go back to school.<br /><br />
        A few months later was when the COVID lockdown started. During this
        time, a buddy of mine introduced me to trading stocks. And this led me
        down a really interesting path. Instead of video games, I was now
        addicted to trading. I was totally convinced you could make 5-10% per
        day just by scalping futures. I would spend hours, some days up to quite
        literally 18 hours, staring at the charts, perfecting my craft. I'm
        still not thoroughly convinced it can't be done; Wall St exists for a
        reason. Nonetheless, this chapter also represents another theme in my
        life: an inclination for shortcuts. Instead of accepting that I didn't
        know better than everyone on the planet, and following the proven path,
        I spent over a year and a half practicing something that ultimately
        provided nothing but wasted time.

        <br /><br />
        But it wasn't completely wasted. I was having minor success trading,
        believe it or not, but nothing stable enough to prevent me from aging
        10x the speed of a normal man, nor enough to quit working. Thus, I had
        the idea that if it was taking too long for me to learn how to profit
        from the markets, then I could just engineer a robot to do it for me. No
        emotions, no mistakes, no watching the charts for hours. Just press a
        button and make money. And so, instead of spending hours staring at
        charts, I context-switched to spending hours writing Python code. And
        thus birthed the love for programming. My trading algorithm went through
        a few different phases, and ultimately came together one last time in my
        Bachelor's capstone. That one was for long term stocks, which may prove
        to be a profitable strategy, who knows. But the inital program, for
        scalping forex, was not. The fees were too high, the program was too
        slow, and Wall St was too fast. But I didn't care about trading anymore
        -- all I wanted to do was program stuff. And the rest, as they say...

        <h1 class="about-chapter-header">Today</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="page-about-text">
        Today, I'd like to think I'm a different man than the one I've just
        written about. My past was characterized and controlled by fear. I let
        fear dominate my whole life: women, sports, academics, career, finances,
        the list goes on. Today, I have a system in place to conquer fear. I
        have a system in place to keep my hobbies hobby'd and my goals goal'd.
        Today, I no longer turn my back to my past, but instead, I try my best
        to face it; to embrace it-- and I make damn sure that I don't repeat the
        same mistakes. <br /><br />
        It's incredibly obvious to me today that facing my past is the key to my
        successful future. Not running from it. Not burying it. Staring at it,
        dead in the eyes, but with compassion, not judgment. Doing so has given
        me the chance to understand my wounds, to love the person I once was,
        but above all else, and so so importantly, it has allowed me to learn,
        and to carry those lessons forward. I believe real hurt and stagnation
        can come from pretending your past doesn't exist. And real growth can
        come from embracing it with self-compassion. I made a lot of mistakes,
        and that's ok. What's not ok is repeating them. It's for these reasons
        that deep, reflective journaling was the best hobby I ever started. It
        has given me a map for the road ahead, a list of things and places to
        avoid. It's my belief that too many people drive through life blind:
        repeating the same mistakes, running over the same potholes over and
        over again. That intrinsic, deeply-ingrained stress from the subconcious
        fear of exactly that is a very real thing, believe me. <br /><br />

        In our hometown, my grandfather owned a body shop. He owned it for 47
        years. My dad ran it for a while but gave it back when we moved to
        Arkansas. I wasn't too involved in the shop growing up--how could I have
        been at &lt;= 12 years old? Regardless, I grew up around cars and body
        work. My dad is also now an instructor for Pilot. So writing estimates
        in college was just something that was almost a given for my brother and
        I. <br /><br />

        My job at Pilot Catastrophe was my first real, big boy job. I had many
        jobs up to that point, like all kids do, but they were the usual kid
        jobs: bus boy, fast food, etc. I remember when my brother and I got the
        call that we were going to work. In Colorado (we lived in Alabama). I
        was terrified. We were employed as automobile adjusters. So I was moving
        from serving people chicken and taking out the trash to being in charge
        of claims worth potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars. None of
        mine ever cost that much, but it was still a big jump.<br /><br />

        Hunter graduated the next year and joined the Navy, but I didn't, so I
        was stuck working for Pilot. It was ok, but I hated not knowing what I
        wanted to do. What I did know was that I didn't want to do this forever.
        Regardless, I was good at it, and as I started to get more and more into
        computers, leadership noticed and moved me to a technical leadership
        position: Technical Advisor. I was essentially in charge of teams of
        adjusters, responsible for every part of them, from how they dressed to
        their customer service to the functionality of their estimating system.
        It was a big job, and a diverse one, and boy it was a stressful one too.
        Trying to keep my bosses happy, the customers happy, the shops happy,
        and trying to teach the adjusters while also being stern was a lot to
        juggle. But it taught me a hell of a lot--it still is. I still work for
        Pilot, although it's on a contract basis. If they need me for a big
        storm, I suppose I'll go. Other than that, I can't say I'm too eager to
        do anything other than write computer programs. I love that shit.

            Circuitry is something I built when I was doing Nand2Tetris
            (shoutout Noam and Shimon, absolute legends). It was really
            fascinating. I built it with Python because I had an idea and wanted
            to get it out quickly. PyGame is a really intuitive API and I
            enjoyed learning the basics of game programming. This project was
            also my first dip into Model-View-Controller. It was confusing as
            hell at first, especially as someone who had used Django in the
            past. IYKYK. <br /><br />

            Future plans for this project? Port it to the web. That'd be cool.

            Student Database originally started as just a small practice file I
            was using to learn function pointers because they made no sense. It
            ended up a humongous API into a simple linked-list. Search for this,
            that, sort by this and that. It was a lot of fun. It may look like
            Python is my favorite language because most of my "official"
            projects are in it. But that's only because it's so easy to ship in
            Python. Python might actually be my least favorite--followed very
            far by C. C is so fun. I love the control, the explicitness. It's a
            good feeling to know someone can break your program, and that you
            can in theory write an unbreakable one. Python has no such depth.

        <project-t project="Statistical Arbitrage">
          <p class="page-projects-text">
            Statistical Arbitrage was v3 or v4 of a financial markets trading
            system. This is the one I submitted as my Bachelor's capstone. Older
            variants actually traded by themselves, fully hands-free, using the
            MetaTrader5 platform. This one is just a web dashboard that pulls
            data from Yahoo Finance, shows historical trades, and tells you if
            there's one today or not. It also plots the data it uses to compute
            entries and exits, but you can't see that in the screenshot.
            <br /><br />
            If you've ever seen the chart of a stock before, you'll know it goes
            up and down a lot. It's mostly Brownian motion, but not 100%--there
            are some underlying patterns and relationships. For example, if you
            look at the chart of two related stocks side-by-side, say, Coke and
            Pepsi, you'll see that they look pretty much the same. Not EXACTLY
            the same, but really close, and that's the point. If you subtract
            the price of one from the other over time, it'd dance around a mean.
            Sometimes it'd go up, sometimes it'd go down, but over time it would
            converge to some mean. In other words, if you plotted a moving
            average with a large enough window, it'd be flat. <br /><br />
            And there's the key idea. We know that if it moves up it'll probably
            come back down. And that if it moves down it'll probably come back
            up. And knowing what will probably happen in the future is exactly
            how you make money in financial markets, assuming you are correct
            more than you're not. Which, believe me, is much harder than it
            looks.

            This one I wrote in about 5 minutes, but it perfectly encapsulates
            my worldview of software. I can't stand bloated programs, programs
            that try to be more than they are, programs that do stuff you didn't
            ask it to and you don't want it to. Maybe it's a control thing, but
            I like my software to conform to the UNIX philosophy: do one thing
            and do it well. And it seems all too common today for software to
            try to do everything. Facebook with its stories and marketplace and
            dating and reels and games and... could go on and on. And you could
            say the same for arguably most stuff nowadays. That drives me up a
            wall. It's my belief that Facebook should be a social media where
            you see your friends' posts in chronological order. Photoshop should
            be a software for editing photos. Google should be a search engine.
            Why does everything need "AI" nowadays? Why does everything try to
            be... everything? We need Web3 asap bruh.
