                            Circuitry is something I built when I was doing Nand2Tetris (shoutout Noam
                            and Shimon, absolute legends). It was really fascinating. I built it with Python 
                            because I had an idea and wanted to get it out quickly. PyGame is a really 
                            intuitive API and I enjoyed learning the basics of game programming. This project
                            was also my first dip into Model-View-Controller. It was confusing as hell at first,
                            especially as someone who had used Django in the past. IYKYK. <br><br>

                            Future plans for this project? Port it to the web. That'd be cool. Could implement a
                            leaderboard, see if anyone can make something Turing-complete.

                        <p class="page-projects-text">
                            Student Database originally started as just a small practice file I was using to 
                            learn function pointers because they made no sense. It ended up a humongous API
                            into a simple linked-list. Search for this, that, sort by this and that. It was 
                            a lot of fun. It may look like Python is my favorite language because most of my
                            "official" projects are in it. But that's only because it's so easy to ship in 
                            Python. Python might actually be my least favorite--followed very far by C. C
                            is so fun. I love the control, the explicitness. It's a good feeling to know
                            someone can break your program, and that you can in theory write an unbreakable
                            one. Python has no such depth.

                        <p class="page-projects-text">
                            Statistical Arbitrage was v3 or v4 of a financial markets trading system. This is the
                            one I submitted as my Bachelor's capstone. Older variants actually traded by themselves,
                            fully hands-free, using the MetaTrader5 platform. This one is just a web dashboard that
                            pulls data from Yahoo Finance, shows historical trades, and tells you if there's one 
                            today or not. It also plots the data it uses to compute entries and exits, but you can't
                            see that in the screenshot. <br><br>
                            If you've ever seen the chart of a stock before, you'll know it goes up and down a lot. 
                            It's mostly Brownian motion, but not 100%--there are some underlying patterns and relationships.
                            For example, if you look at the chart of two related stocks side-by-side, say, Coke and Pepsi,
                            you'll see that they look pretty much the same. Not EXACTLY the same, but really close, and 
                            that's the point. If you subtract the price of one from the other over time, it'd dance
                            around a mean. Sometimes it'd go up, sometimes it'd go down, but over time it would converge
                            to some mean. In other words, if you plotted a moving average with a large enough window,
                            it'd be flat. <br><br>
                            And there's the key idea. We know that if it moves up it'll probably come back down. And that 
                            if it moves down it'll probably come back up. And knowing what will probably happen in the 
                            future is exactly how you make money in financial markets, assuming you are correct more
                            than you're not. Which, believe me, is much harder than it looks.

                            This one I wrote in about 5 minutes, but it perfectly encapsulates my worldview of 
                            software. I can't stand bloated programs, programs that try to be more than they are,
                            programs that do stuff you didn't ask it to and you don't want it to. Maybe it's a control
                            thing, but I like my software to conform to the UNIX philosophy: do one thing and do it
                            well. And it seems all too common today for software to try to do everything. Facebook
                            with its stories and marketplace and dating and reels and games and... could go on and
                            on. And you could say the same for arguably most stuff nowadays. That drives me up a 
                            wall. It's my belief that Facebook should be a social media where you see your friends' 
                            posts in chronological order. Photoshop should be a software for editing photos. Google
                            should be a search engine. Why does everything need "AI" nowadays? Why does everything
                            try to be... everything? We need Web3 asap bruh.
