          In our hometown, my grandfather owned a body shop. He owned it for 47
          years. My dad ran it for a while but gave it back when we moved to
          Arkansas. I wasn't too involved in the shop growing up--how could I
          have been at &lt;= 12 years old? Regardless, I grew up around cars and
          body work. My dad is also now an instructor for Pilot. So writing
          estimates in college was just something that was almost a given for my
          brother and I. <br /><br />

          My job at Pilot Catastrophe was my first real, big boy job. I had many
          jobs up to that point, like all kids do, but they were the usual kid
          jobs: bus boy, fast food, etc. I remember when my brother and I got
          the call that we were going to work. In Colorado (we lived in
          Alabama). I was terrified. We were employed as automobile adjusters.
          So I was moving from serving people chicken and taking out the trash
          to being in charge of claims worth potentially hundreds of thousands
          of dollars. None of mine ever cost that much, but it was still a big
          jump.<br /><br />

          Hunter graduated the next year and joined the Navy, but I didn't, so I
          was stuck working for Pilot. It was ok, but I hated not knowing what I
          wanted to do. What I did know was that I didn't want to do this
          forever. Regardless, I was good at it, and as I started to get more
          and more into computers, leadership noticed and moved me to a
          technical leadership position: Technical Advisor. I was essentially in
          charge of teams of adjusters, responsible for every part of them, from
          how they dressed to their customer service to the functionality of
          their estimating system. It was a big job, and a diverse one, and boy
          it was a stressful one too. Trying to keep my bosses happy, the
          customers happy, the shops happy, and trying to teach the adjusters
          while also being stern was a lot to juggle. But it taught me a hell of
          a lot--it still is. I still work for Pilot, although it's on a
          contract basis. If they need me for a big storm, I suppose I'll go.
          Other than that, I can't say I'm too eager to do anything other than
          write computer programs. I love that shit.
