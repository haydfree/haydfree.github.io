                My name is Hayden. This website may make me look like I'm schizo or something. I get it. I'm not. 
                At least, I don't think I am. I've never been professionally evaluated, and I'm not a psychiatrist,
                so I guess I can't really say. I'm just goofing around, having fun. Maybe that's what I am for sure 
                qualified to say: I like goofing around and having fun. If you are here for a professional resume, you 
                aren't getting one. I'm not an HR robot's delight, that's for sure -- I'm a human being. A weird one, 
                perhaps an abrasive and offensive one, but a human nonetheless. <br><br>

                I refuse to conform to your standards. Life is a game. None of this matters, so I refuse to take things
                too seriously. I am writing this because it's fun. I made this website because it was fun. I program 
                because it's fun. I won't let you business majors take that away from me.
