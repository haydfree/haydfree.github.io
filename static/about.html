                My name is Hayden. This website may make me look like I'm schizo or something. I get it. I'm not. 
                At least, I don't think I am. I've never been professionally evaluated, and I'm not a psychiatrist,
                so I guess I can't really say. I'm just goofing around, having fun. Maybe that's what I am for sure 
                qualified to say: I like goofing around and having fun. If you are here for a professional resume, you 
                aren't getting one. I'm not an HR robot's delight, that's for sure -- I'm a human being. A weird one, 
                perhaps an abrasive and offensive one, but a human nonetheless. <br><br>

                I refuse to conform to your standards. Life is a game. None of this matters, so I refuse to take things
                too seriously. I am writing this because it's fun. I made this website because it was fun. I program 
                because it's fun. I won't let you business majors take that away from me. <br><br>

                I was born in Fairhope, AL. I grew up in a small town east of there called Elberta. 
                Elberta, at least what I remember of it, was beautiful. It was amazing. We had a big
                house, with a pool, and were always having people over. Everyone wanted to come to our
                house. Life was great, for the most part, until 7th grade and I started playing football.
                I... didn't know how to play football. Running back? Nope. Linebacker? No. How many
                points was a touchdown? Well... I knew that, but that's about it. You can imagine that
                trying to play football while not know what the hell your job was was pretty strange. 
                Add to that I was a pretty shy kid--I wasn't going to ask my coach in front of everyone
                how to play {insert position here}. Me not knowing how to play of course made me bad. 
                Me being bad made the kids older than me, the 8th graders, bully me. I think that's 
                probably where my low self-esteem started. <br><br>

                And this pattern continued as long as I felt pushed to play football -- which was 
                through 10th grade. In 10th grade, I was two schools past Elberta. We moved to 
                Maumelle, AR the winter after 7th grade football season. My parents got divorced
                during this era. During the summer of 9-10th grade, we moved from Maumelle to 
                Bryant. At both Maumelle and Bryant, I met some amazing friends--people I'm still
                friends with today. But the pattern of me playing football when I was too small and
                didn't care to anyways persisted. During the summer of 10-11th grade, I finally
                quit. <br><br> 

                We grew up Auburn fans, so I planned my whole life to go to Auburn. Even when we were
                in Arkansas. But out-of-state tuition is expensive, so my brother and I decided to move
                back to AL to stay with our dad our final year of high school so we could get in-state
                tuition. This was an awesome idea, we made many great friends here too. In Maumelle and 
                Bryant, our friends were goodie goodies, for the most part. Maybe we were all just too 
                young. But at Gulf Shores, the vibe was so different. Everyone smoked weed, drank, and
                partied on weekends. Getting thrown into that was a culture shock for sure. I had my first
                beer, smoked weed for the first time, and had sex for the first time. In fact, I indulged
                in the former two probably far more than I should have. The latter, for me, like many other
                men, has always been difficult, so there was certainly no over-indulgence there. <br><br> 
                
                In 2015, I graduated high school. Somehow, I managed to make a 3.5 GPA and a 27 on the ACT,
                without much effort, which was a core theme of my life up to and including this time. This
                gave me a little bit of scholarship money for Auburn, which of course was nice. At Auburn,
                I was pretty secluded--the bar scene made me nervous. I didn't make or have many friends. 
                Staying home and smoking weed was far more attractive than going to bars or parties and
                certainly class. I knew pretty quickly after getting to Auburn that I didn't want to major
                in Biochemistry anymore, and I didn't want to be a doctor. But I kept on keeping on. It's ok,
                looking back; I was doing the best I could with what I knew at the time. But boy, if anyone
                is reading this and in or preparing for college, if there's one single piece of advice I can
                offer you, it's this: change your major. Major in something you love. If you don't know what
                you love, what your purpose is--then it is your purpose to find your purpose. Do NOT do 4 years
                of a degree that you don't care about. In the past, just getting your degree may have been all 
                that mattered--I certainly don't believe that to be the case anymore. There are too many
                people with degrees, and not enough of the jobs that these people want. It's a simple supply
                and demand issue. <br><br>

                After Auburn was arguably even harder. I was confused and lost and didn't know what I
                wanted. During COVID, a buddy of mine introduced me to trading stocks. And this led me
                down a really interesting path. Instead of video games, I was now addicted to trading.
                I was totally convinced you could make 5-10% per day just by scalping futures. I would
                spend hours, some days up to quite literally 18 hours, staring at the charts, perfecting
                my craft. I'm still not thoroughly convinced it can't be done; Wall St exists for a 
                reason. But I had to step away--it was taking too long to get to a point where I had some
                stable income. I wasn't working out, eating well, socializing... had to make a change.<br><br>

                So I found programming. I had the idea that if it was taking too long for me to learn how
                to profit from the markets, then I could just make a robot do it for me. No emotions, no
                mistakes, no watching the charts for hours. Just press a button and make money. And so,
                instead of spending hours staring at charts, I moved to spending hours writing Python
                code. And thus birthed the love for programming. My trading algorithm went through a
                few different phases, and ultimately came together one last time in my Bachelor's 
                capstone. That one was for long term stocks, which may prove to be a profitable 
                strategy, who knows. But the inital program, for scalping forex, was not. The fees
                were too high, the program was too slow, and Wall St was too fast. But I didn't care
                about trading anymore -- all I wanted to do was program stuff. And the rest, as they say...
