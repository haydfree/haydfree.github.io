                My name is Hayden. This website may make me look like I'm schizo or something. I get it. I'm not. At
                least, I don't think I am. I've never been professionally evaluated, and I'm not a psychiatrist, so I
                guess I can't really say. I'm just goofing around, having fun. Maybe that's what I am for sure qualified
                to say: I like goofing around and having fun. If you are here for a professional resume, you aren't
                getting one. I'm not an HR robot's delight, that's for sure -- I'm a human being. A weird one, perhaps
                an abrasive and offensive one, but a human nonetheless. <br><br> I refuse to conform to your standards.
                Life is a game. None of this matters, so I refuse to take things too seriously. I am writing this
                because it's fun. I made this website because it was fun. I program because it's fun. I won't let you
                business majors take that away from me. <br><br>

                I was born in Fairhope, Alabama, and grew up in a small town east of there called Elberta. What I
                remember of Elberta was beautiful. We lived in a big house with a pool, a waterslide, golf carts,
                four-wheelers, and dirt bikes. People were always at our house--it was the place to be. Life was good,
                at least on the surface. But I still carried my share of struggles: fitting in, chasing popularity, and
                trying to figure out how to get girls.<br><br> In 7th grade, I joined the football team. I was terrible.
                "Was I just born bad at football?" I asked myself. At the time, it never occurred to me that skills
                could be learned--that with effort, discipline, and time, I could improve. This became one of the
                defining themes of my early life: the mistaken belief that talent is innate, that you're either born
                with it or you're not. I now know that while some people may be naturally inclined toward certain
                things, skill in anything is ultimately a function of consistent effort. If I want to be good at
                something, I can. Put in the time. <br><br></p>

            <p class="page-about-text">
                In December of 2009, when I was 12, we moved to Arkansas--where my mom was from. The city of choice,
                Maumelle, was a great place. I met lots of amazing people here, and am still friends to this day with
                some of them. Maumelle, in my mind, was characterized by typical teenage debauchery. I remember one time
                we rolled people's houses with toilet paper until 4 in the morning and had to ride home in the backs of
                police cars. I had my struggles here too, though--just like in Elberta, with sports, popularity, and
                girls, I struggled with those things in Maumelle as well. What I didn't struggle with was my Call of
                Duty k/d. I remember in the Modern Warfare 3 era being well beyond my friends in terms of my prestige
                level. I was backpacking my squad so hard. I took pride in my performance in video games, another theme
                that'd persist throughout my later years.<br><br> A few years later, we moved to Bryant. Met a lot of
                great people here too. I'd say most of my good friends today I met at Bryant. I remember being so bad at
                football that our coaches at Bryant put my twin brother Hunter and I in the same locker. Yeah, I should
                have quit then and there. But, that's another theme of my life: not sticking up for myself. Choosing
                comfort over self-respect. And this theme, too, would persist. I did finally quit football after 10th
                grade. <br><br> We grew up Auburn fans, so I planned my whole life to go to Auburn. Even when we were in
                Arkansas. But out-of-state tuition is expensive, so Hunter and I decided to move back to AL to stay with
                our dad our final year of high school. That way, we could get in-state tuition. This was an awesome
                idea; I made many great friends here too. But here in Gulf Shores, the vibe was so different. Everyone
                smoked weed, drank, and partied on weekends. Getting thrown into that was a culture shock for sure.
                During my senior year here, I had my first beer, smoked weed for the first time, and had sex for the
                first time too. In fact, I indulged in the former two probably far more than I should have. At one of
                the many parties we threw, some kid there got drunk on Crown Royal, decided to take a bath, and fell
                asleep with the faucet running. The whole house flooded. It was hours later before anyone found
                him--butt-naked, but alive. <br><br> In 2015, I graduated high school. Thanks to the lack of difficulty
                in the AL curriculum, I managed to just barely snag a 3.5 GPA. With my 27 on the ACT, I was eligible to
                get a little bit of scholarship money. With the miniscule effort I put into my high school work, this
                was quite an accomplishment. What wasn't an accomplishment though was the fact that I didn't even apply
                for scholarship money. Scared of failing? Too lazy to do it? Not thinking about the future? All of the
                above. This is yet another core theme: inaction due to fear.

            <p class="page-about-text">
                At Auburn, I was pretty secluded--the bar scene made me nervous. I didn't make or have many friends.
                Staying home and smoking weed was far more attractive than going to bars or parties and certainly class.
                I knew pretty quickly after getting to Auburn that I didn't want to major in Biochemistry anymore, and I
                didn't want to be a doctor. But I kept on keeping on. Looking back, I was doing the best I could with
                what I knew at the time. What I didn't know at the time was best for me though was to suck it up, figure
                out what I wanted to do, and change my major. <br><br> Boy, if anyone is reading this and in or
                preparing for college, if there's one single piece of advice I can offer you, it's this: major in
                something you love. If you don't know what you love, what your mission is--then it is your mission to
                find your mission. I would highly advise against doing 4 years of a degree that you don't care about.
                <br><br> My time at Auburn was characterized by a severe lack of partying, drinking, sex, and class, and
                a severe overdose of Fortnite and working out. I didn't know what I wanted. So I did the logical thing--
                avoidance. It was a pretty dark time in my life. I think what I had lacked was one of the most important
                parts of being a mentally healthy human being: having something that you love, and working on it. Every
                single day. And when you don't have that, I think, as demonstrated in my experience, it becomes really
                hard to be happy. It makes sense evolutionarily; we evolved the dopaminergic pathway for a reason. This
                era is therefore characterized by another theme: refusal to make the hard choice.

                When I wasn't playing Fornite, I was trying to learn dropshipping. If you aren't familiar, dropshipping
                is an online "side-hustle" type business model where you sell products, but instead of holding physical
                inventory, you just buy from a vendor and ship it directly to your customer. I was totally unconvinced I
                wouldn't be mega-rich from this. This is actually where I got my first introduction to coding; I was
                using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to customize my Shopify stores. <br><br> Due to my extreme addiction to
                video games and my newfound obsession with dropshipping, my prioritization of class was moved from -1 to
                -10. I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I went to class during my final year. As is
                customary with students who don't attend class, I performed poorly--so poorly in fact that I flunked out
                in my final year. Due to my guaranteed success with dropshipping, I decided to focus on it, and not go
                back to school.<br><br> A few months later was when the COVID lockdown started. During this time, a
                buddy of mine introduced me to trading stocks. And this led me down a really interesting path. Instead
                of video games, I was now addicted to trading. I was totally convinced you could make 5-10% per day just
                by scalping futures. I would spend hours, some days up to quite literally 18 hours, staring at the
                charts, perfecting my craft. I'm still not thoroughly convinced it can't be done; Wall St exists for a
                reason. Nonetheless, this chapter also represents another theme in my life: an inclination for
                shortcuts. Instead of accepting that I didn't know better than everyone on the planet, and following the
                proven path, I spent over a year and a half practicing something that ultimately provided nothing but
                wasted time.

                <br><br> But it wasn't completely wasted. I was having minor success trading, believe it or not, but
                nothing stable enough to prevent me from aging 10x the speed of a normal man, nor enough to quit
                working. Thus, I had the idea that if it was taking too long for me to learn how to profit from the
                markets, then I could just engineer a robot to do it for me. No emotions, no mistakes, no watching the
                charts for hours. Just press a button and make money. And so, instead of spending hours staring at
                charts, I context-switched to spending hours writing Python code. And thus birthed the love for
                programming. My trading algorithm went through a few different phases, and ultimately came together one
                last time in my Bachelor's capstone. That one was for long term stocks, which may prove to be a
                profitable strategy, who knows. But the inital program, for scalping forex, was not. The fees were too
                high, the program was too slow, and Wall St was too fast. But I didn't care about trading anymore -- all
                I wanted to do was program stuff. And the rest, as they say...

                Today, I'd like to think I'm a different man than the one I've just written about. My past was
                characterized and controlled by fear. I let fear dominate my whole life: women, sports, academics,
                career, finances, the list goes on. Today, I have a system in place to conquer fear. I have a system in
                place to keep my hobbies hobby'd and my goals goal'd. Today, I no longer turn my back to my past, but
                instead, I try my best to face it; to embrace it-- and I make damn sure that I don't repeat the same
                mistakes. <br><br> It's incredibly obvious to me today that facing my past is the key to my successful
                future. Not running from it. Not burying it. Staring at it, dead in the eyes, but with compassion, not
                judgment. Doing so has given me the chance to understand my wounds, to love the person I once was, but
                above all else, and so so importantly, it has allowed me to learn, and to carry those lessons forward. I
                believe real hurt and stagnation can come from pretending your past doesn't exist. And real growth can
                come from embracing it with self-compassion. I made a lot of mistakes, and that's ok. What's not ok is
                repeating them. It's for these reasons that deep, reflective journaling was the best hobby I ever
                started. It has given me a map for the road ahead, a list of things and places to avoid. It's my belief
                that too many people drive through life blind: repeating the same mistakes, running over the same
                potholes over and over again. That intrinsic, deeply-ingrained stress from the subconcious fear of
                exactly that is a very real thing, believe me. <br><br> "It is my biggest fear today to be the man I was
                yesterday."
