                My name is Hayden. This website may make me look like I'm schizo or something. I get it. I'm not. 
                At least, I don't think I am. I've never been professionally evaluated, and I'm not a psychiatrist,
                so I guess I can't really say. I'm just goofing around, having fun. Maybe that's what I am for sure 
                qualified to say: I like goofing around and having fun. If you are here for a professional resume, you 
                aren't getting one. I'm not an HR robot's delight, that's for sure -- I'm a human being. A weird one, 
                perhaps an abrasive and offensive one, but a human nonetheless. <br><br>

                I refuse to conform to your standards. Life is a game. None of this matters, so I refuse to take things
                too seriously. I am writing this because it's fun. I made this website because it was fun. I program 
                because it's fun. I won't let you business majors take that away from me. <br><br>

                <p class="page-about-text">
                I was born in Fairhope, AL. I grew up in a small town east of there called Elberta. 
                Elberta, at least what I remember of it, was beautiful. It was amazing. We had a big
                house, with a pool and a waterslide. We had a golf cart and four wheelers and dirt bikes. 
                We were always having people over. Everyone wanted to come to our
                house. Life was great, for the most part. I had my fair share of early struggles though. 
                Girls, fitting in, being popular, the whole nine yards. In 7th grade, I joined the football team.
                <br><br>
                Except, I... didn't know how to play football. Running back? Nope. Linebacker? No. How many
                points was a touchdown? Well... I knew that, but that's about it. You can imagine that
                trying to play football while not knowing what the hell you were supposed to do was pretty strange. 
                Add to that I was a shy kid--I certainly wasn't going to ask my coach in front of everyone
                how to play. Me not knowing how to play of course made me bad. 
                Me being bad made the other kids pick on me. Looking back, I think that's probably where my low self-esteem 
                started. It's tough to be confident when you're shorter than everyone else, and people make fun of
                you for it, and you suck at football, and get picked on for it. Was I just born to be bad at football? 
                It didn't occur to me back then that you could just... learn things. If I wanted to be better at 
                something, I could; I just had to work at it. Every day. This is a core theme of my past, not
                understanding that skills and talent aren't innate--you aren't either born with it or not. I
                believe some people are born more naturally inclined towards some things, sure. Ultimately,
                though, your skill level in anything is a function of the time you've put in.

                <p class="page-about-text">
                In December of 2009, when I was 12, we moved to Arkansas--where my mom was from. This city,
                Maumelle, was a great place. I met lots of amazing people here, and am still friends to this
                day with some of them. Maumelle, in my mind, was characterized by typical teenage debauchery. 
                I remember one time we rolled people's houses with toilet paper until 4 in the morning and had to ride home in
                the backs of police cars. I had my struggles here too, though--just like in Elberta, with sports,
                popularity, and girls, I struggled with those things in Maumelle as well. What I didn't
                struggle with was my Call of Duty k/d. I remember in the Modern Warfare 3 era being well beyond my
                friends in terms of my prestige level. I was backpacking my squad so hard. I took pride in my performance in video games, another theme
                that'd persist throughout my later years.<br><br> 

                A few years later, we moved to Bryant. It was essentially the same as Maumelle, just with different
                people. Met a lot of great people here too. I'd say most of my good friends today I met at Bryant. 
                I remember being so bad at football that our coaches at Bryant put my twin brother Hunter and I in 
                the same locker. Yeah, I should have quit then and there. But, I played throughout 10th grade and 
                finally quit during the next summer. <br><br>

                We grew up Auburn fans, so I planned my whole life to go to Auburn. Even when we were
                in Arkansas. But out-of-state tuition is expensive, so Hunter and I decided to move
                back to AL to stay with our dad our final year of high school. That way, we could get in-state
                tuition. This was an awesome idea; I made many great friends here too. In Maumelle and 
                Bryant, our friends were goodie goodies, for the most part. Maybe we were all just too 
                young. But at Gulf Shores, the vibe was so different. Everyone smoked weed, drank, and
                partied on weekends. Getting thrown into that was a culture shock for sure. I had my first
                beer, smoked weed for the first time, and had sex for the first time too. In fact, I indulged
                in the former two probably far more than I should have. At one of the many parties we threw here,
                some kid there got drunk on Crown Royal, decided to take a bath, fell asleep with it running,
                and flooded the house. It was hours later before anyone found him, butt-naked but alive. 
                <br><br></p>

                <div class="about-chapter-header-container">
                    <h1 class="about-chapter-header">Auburn</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="page-about-text">
                In 2015, I graduated high school. Thanks to the lack of difficulty in curriculum, 
                I managed to make a 3.5 GPA and a 27 on the ACT,
                with very little effort, which was a core theme of my life up to and including this time. This
                gave me a little bit of scholarship money for Auburn, which of course was nice. At Auburn,
                I was pretty secluded--the bar scene made me nervous. I didn't make or have many friends. 
                Staying home and smoking weed was far more attractive than going to bars or parties and
                certainly class. I knew pretty quickly after getting to Auburn that I didn't want to major
                in Biochemistry anymore, and I didn't want to be a doctor. But I kept on keeping on. It's ok,
                looking back; I was doing the best I could with what I knew at the time. <br><br>

                But boy, if anyone
                is reading this and in or preparing for college, if there's one single piece of advice I can
                offer you, it's this: major in something you love. If you don't know what
                you love, what your purpose is--then it is your purpose to find your purpose. Do NOT do 4 years
                of a degree that you don't care about. <br><br>

                My time at Auburn was characterized by a severe lack of partying, drinking, sex, and class, and a severe
                overdose of Fortnite and working out. I didn't know what I wanted. So I did the logical thing--
                avoidance. I was alone, scared, and confused, and it was a pretty dark time in my life. I think that's
                one of the most important aspects of being human: having something that you love, and working on it.
                Every single day. And when you don't have that, I think, as demonstrated in my experience, it becomes 
                really hard to be happy. It makes sense evolutionarily; we evolved the dopaminergic pathway for a reason.

                <p class="page-about-text">
                After Auburn was arguably even harder. During COVID, a buddy of mine introduced me to trading stocks. And this led me
                down a really interesting path. Instead of video games, I was now addicted to trading.
                I was totally convinced you could make 5-10% per day just by scalping futures. I would
                spend hours, some days up to quite literally 18 hours, staring at the charts, perfecting
                my craft. I'm still not thoroughly convinced it can't be done; Wall St exists for a 
                reason. But I had to step away--it was taking too long to get to a point where I had some
                stable income. I wasn't working out, eating well, socializing... had to make a change.<br><br>

                So I found programming. I had the idea that if it was taking too long for me to learn how
                to profit from the markets, then I could just make a robot do it for me. No emotions, no
                mistakes, no watching the charts for hours. Just press a button and make money. And so,
                instead of spending hours staring at charts, I moved to spending hours writing Python
                code. And thus birthed the love for programming. My trading algorithm went through a
                few different phases, and ultimately came together one last time in my Bachelor's 
                capstone. That one was for long term stocks, which may prove to be a profitable 
                strategy, who knows. But the inital program, for scalping forex, was not. The fees
                were too high, the program was too slow, and Wall St was too fast. But I didn't care
                about trading anymore -- all I wanted to do was program stuff. And the rest, as they say...

                <div class="about-chapter-header-container">
                    <h1 class="about-chapter-header">Today</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="page-about-text">
                Today, I'd like to think I'm a different man than the boy of my past. The past boy was characterized and
                controlled by fear. He let fear dominate his whole life: women, sports, academics, career, the list goes on. 
                Today, I have a system in place to conquer fear. I have a system in place to keep my hobbies hobbied and 
                myself on a path towards my goals. Today, I no longer turn my back to my past, but instead, I face it, I
                embrace it, and I make damn sure that I don't repeat the same mistakes. <br><br>

                It's incredibly obvious to me today that 
                facing my past is the key to my successful future. Not running from it. Not burying it. Staring at it, dead in the 
                eyes, but with compassion, not judgment. Doing so gives you the chance to 
                understand your wounds, to love the person you once were, but above all else, and so so importantly, it allows you to
                carry those lessons forward. Real 
                hurt and stagnation can come from pretending your past doesn't exist. And real growth can come from embracing it--
                so completely that it no longer controls you. 
                It's for these reasons that deep, reflective journaling was the best hobby I ever started. It gave me a map for the 
                road
                ahead, a list of things and places to avoid. It's my belief that most people walk through life blind: repeating
                the same mistakes, driving over the same potholes over and over. <br><br>
                "It is my biggest fear today to be the man I was yesterday."
